📚 Library Management System – Version 2
Welcome to the second version of my project, Library Management System!
This project was developed as part of the course "Mastering Critical Thinking in C++" by Dr. Mostafa Saad.

📝 Project Summary
This project simulates a Library Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++.
It involves the following main components:

Book: Represents each book, including its ID, title, quantity, and list of users who borrowed it.

User: Represents a library user who can borrow and return books.

Admin: Handles administrative tasks such as adding books, managing users, and viewing borrowing activity.

Loan_Service: Manages the borrowing and returning process.

🔧 Key Features:
Add and search for books by name prefix

Display all books sorted by ID

Show users and the books they’ve borrowed

Identify who borrowed a specific book

Admin login system for secure access

This system was designed following core OOP principles such as:

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Separation of concerns

Usage of C++ STL (vector, string, find_if, etc.) for efficient data handling
